\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	Lattice-based cryptography is assumed quantum-safe.
	
	\underline{Lattice-based signatures:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \cite{GoldreichGH97a} was later broken by \cite{NguyenR09}.
		\item NTRU signatures \cite{HoffsteinPS01} was attacked by \cite{GentryS02}. It was then fixed in \cite{HoffsteinHPSW03} and was broken in \cite{NguyenR09}.
		\item ``Hash-and-sign'' paradigm \cite{GentryPV08} was inefficient.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Contribution of This Paper}
	\underline{Contributions of this paper \cite{Lyubashevsky12}:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Adapt \cite{Lyubashevsky09} to construct signatures based on standard SIS assumptions (to be presented).
		\item Reduce signature size analogous to works for ``hash-and-sign'' paradigm.
		\item Reduce to shorter signature size using LWE assumption \cite{Regev09}.
	\end{itemize}
